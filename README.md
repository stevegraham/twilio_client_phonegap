# Twilio Client Phonegap plugins

This is a Phonegap plugin that exposes the same JS API as Twilio Client for web as much as possible, meaning you should be able to use the same Twilio Client code from your web application inside of your Phonegap application with few if any modifications. 

##Instructions

- Follow the directions to create a new PhoneGap/Cordova iOS application.

- Follow the instructions in the Twilio iOS client quickstart, e.g. copy headers and static lib into your xcode project, link required frameworks, linker flags, etc.

- Copy the Objective-C files into the `plugins` directory of your Phonegap project, and the JavaScript file into the `www` directory.

- Add a new plugin XML item in config.xml:
    <feature name="TCPlugin">
        <param name="ios-package" value="TCPlugin" />
    </feature>

## Limitations

This is plugin is a first cut and should be considered alpha. Please use it and break it :) Report any issues using the Github issue tracker.

Some of the event handlers are currently no-ops because of differences between the web SDK and the iOS SDK, i.e. they both expose events the other does not, e.g. Twilio.Device.cancel is a no-op and there is no JS SDK notion of `-(void)deviceDidStartListeningForIncomingConnections:(TCDevice*)device`, etc. 

Twilio.Connection objects are just proxy objects that delegate to the Objective-C layer.

Sounds are currently disabled and the JS methods that control them are no-ops because enabling them causes `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` errors. Will fix.

Methods that interrogate the client device or connection and return a result e.g. `Twilio.Device.status()` take a callback function with the response as the argument. Unfortunately I think this is unavoidable due to communication between the Phonegap JS and iOS layers being strictly asynchronous, e.g.

```javascript
Twilio.Device.connect(function(connection) {
    alert(connection.status());
})
```

becomes:

```javascript
Twilio.Device.connect(function(connection) {
    connection.status(function(status) { alert(status) });
})
```
